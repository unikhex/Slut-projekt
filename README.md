# *Qr-code generator and Decoder*

## *Description*

This here is a Qr code generator in which encodes texts or links that it is given and it could also decode already existing qr codes.

## *Language/ Built with*

Python 3.9
Markdown

## *Requirements*

install pyqrcode
install pyzbar
import Image
import os

## *Installation*

Using the Terminal or the Commandpropmt use pip to install pyqrcode, pyzbar and Image.
The commands used are :

- pip install pyqrcode
- pip install pyzbar
- pip install Image

 First is installing the needed imports from python.
 This is done by writing:

- pip install (name of  the installation)
- i.e pip install pyqrcode
- pip install pyzbar
- pip install Image.

If there is a problem with installing through the terminal,
 open command prompt and do it throught there.

 If there still a problem', check the directoru in which pip is, copy that and do it there.

 Example being -- C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Python\scripts
 then there install the needed imports.

## *How it functions*

## *Roadmap*

## *Changelog for everyversion*

v_1

Nothing much done here
installation of imports

v_1.2

Done with the writing of the code.

The code functions. As in you can encode a link or text behind a picture.

v_1.3

Done with creating a decoder of the qr code.

v_1.4

Most of the time was spent looking for a way to read the name of the qr picture so that i can decode it directly.

V-1.5

Started created the menu and fuctions in which the decode and encoder were in

v_1.6

Creating a better system for the saves and calling the saves back to the decoder.

v_1.7

Too much was being shown in the terminal when i asked the decoder to ddecode.

Fixing this was was attaching (ascii) to the data.decode.

v_1.8

Done with the menu, functions, the save and the calling back the saves.

## *What was removed*

removed a global that made my code. Made it buggy

Had functions for decoding but they didnt work so they were removes.

## *Problems that i had*

in v_1.8

There was a bug that you couldnt start the proess since you couldnt input anything.

- It was fixed by deleting one input since  i had tw inputs in the same place asking the same thing.
